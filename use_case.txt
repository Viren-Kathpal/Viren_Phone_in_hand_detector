USE CASE: Phone In Hand Detection

Overview:
----------
This application is designed to identify instances where individuals are holding a phone in their hands, using computer vision and YOLOv8. It is ideal for environments where phone usage needs to be monitored or restricted â€” such as offices, exam centers, classrooms, or industrial areas.

Scenarios:
----------
1. Office Surveillance:
   - Detect unauthorized mobile phone usage during working hours.
   - Support HR or Admin staff with visual records.

2. Exam Monitoring:
   - Check if students are using phones during an exam from CCTV footage.
   - Works for both live frames and recorded video/image review.

3. Industrial Safety:
   - Alert management when workers are using phones in hazardous areas.

4. Productivity Analysis:
   - Hourly logs can be integrated for behavior trends or employee monitoring.

Technology Stack:
-----------------
- YOLOv8 (Pretrained model - no training required)
- Streamlit for Web UI
- OpenCV for processing
- PyTorch backend

Outputs:
--------
- Annotated image or video with bounding boxes.
- Label at top indicating number of phones detected.
- Outputs saved in organized folders.
